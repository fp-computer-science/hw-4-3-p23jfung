### Tables
---

Create a copy of the `template.html` file and rename it `hw-4-3.html`. Create a webpage in this file that displays your Prep schedule in a table for one day in the 6 day cycle on which this class meets. Be sure it contains:

* 8 rows and 2 columns. (1 pts.)
* A table heading in the first row that spans both columns and displays "_______'s Schedule". Put your name in the blank. (2 pts.)
* A table heading in the second row that spans both columns and displays "Day __". Put the day number in the blank. (2 pt.)
* The name of the period in the left column for each row. (3 pts.)
* A table heading in for Lunch that spans both columns. Be sure to put it in row 6 if you have Berchmans lunch or row 7 if you have Xavier lunch. (2 pts.)
* The names of each class you have when you have it in the second column. (3 pts.)
* A paragraph containing a signature line (the copyright symbol, your name and the current year). (1 pt.)
